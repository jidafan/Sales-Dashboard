### Introduction
The project shown is a sales dashboard that displays sales data and customer data from a fictitious superstore. The dashboard has two views, one that displays profit and sales data, and the other that displays customer data with the top 10 customers and orders.

### Data

The data used for this project came from the public data sets that Tableau provides. The list of data sets can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data) and the data set used was the superstore sales data set. 

### Dashboard

#### Creation

To create the dashboard, various calculated fields were created for the dashboard and charts showcasing the information such as timelines, heatmaps, bar charts and other charts. To enhance the information, various drill-down features were implemented to provide additional information. To make the dashboard more interactable, filters are presented at the top of each dashboard to allow users to navigate the dashboard. A navigation panel is present on the left side of each dashboard that allows users to navigate through each dashboard.
