### Introduction
The project shown is a sales dashboard that displays sales data and customer data from a fictitious superstore. The dashboard has two views, one that displays profit and sales data, and the other that displays customer data with the top 10 customers and orders.

### Data

The data sourced for this project came from the public data sets that Tableau provides. The list of data sets can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data) and the data set used was the super store data set.
